B.3	String Functions: <string.h>
There are two groups of string functions defined in the header <string.h>. The first have names beginning with str; the second have names beginning with mem. Except for memmove, the behavior is undefined if copying takes place between overlapping objects. Comparison functions treat arguments as unsigned char arrays.
 
In the following table, variables s and t are of type char *; cs and ct are of type const char
*; n is of type size_t; and c is an int converted to char. char *strcpy(s,ct) copy string ct to string s, including '\0'; return s.
  char
*strncpy(s,ct,n)
  copy at most n characters of string ct to s; return s. Pad with '\0''s if ct has fewer than n characters.
  char *strcat(s,ct) concatenate string ct to end of string s; return s.
  char
*strncat(s,ct,n)
  concatenate at most n characters of string ct to string s, terminate s with '\0'; return s.
  int strcmp(cs,ct)	compare string cs to string ct, return <0 if cs<ct, 0 if cs==ct, or >0 if cs>ct.
  int strncmp(cs,ct,n)
  compare at most n characters of string cs to string ct; return <0 if cs<ct, 0 if cs==ct, or >0 if cs>ct.
  char *strchr(cs,c) return pointer to first occurrence of c in cs or NULL if not present. char *strrchr(cs,c) return pointer to last occurrence of c in cs or NULL if not present.
  size_t strspn(cs,ct) size_t strcspn(cs,ct) char
*strpbrk(cs,ct)
  return length of prefix of cs consisting of characters in ct. return length of prefix of cs consisting of characters not in ct. return pointer to first occurrence in string cs of any character string ct, or NULL if not present.
  char *strstr(cs,ct) return pointer to first occurrence of string ct in cs, or NULL if not present. size_t strlen(cs)  return length of cs. char *strerror(n) return pointer to implementation-defined string corresponding to error n. char *strtok(s,ct) strtok searches s for tokens delimited by characters from ct; see below.
A sequence of calls of strtok(s,ct) splits s into tokens, each delimited by a character from ct. The first call in a sequence has a non-NULL s, it finds the first token in s consisting of characters not in ct; it terminates that by overwriting the next character of s with '\0' and returns a pointer to the token. Each subsequent call, indicated by a NULL value of s, returns the next such token, searching from just past the end of the previous one. strtok returns NULL when no further token is found. The string ct may be different on each call.
The mem... functions are meant for manipulating objects as character arrays; the intent is an interface to efficient routines. In the following table, s and t are of type void *; cs and ct are of type const void *; n is of type size_t; and c is an int converted to an unsigned char.
  void
*memcpy(s,ct,n) void
*memmove(s,ct,n)
  copy n characters from ct to s, and return s. same as memcpy except that it works even if the objects overlap.
  int memcmp(cs,ct,n) compare the first n characters of cs with ct; return as with strcmp.
  void
*memchr(cs,c,n)
  return pointer to first occurrence of character c in cs, or NULL if not present among the first n characters.
  void *memset(s,c,n) place character c into first n characters of s, return s.
